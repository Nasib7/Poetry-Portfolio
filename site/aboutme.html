            <h2>About me:</h2>
    <p>
        Hello! My name is Nasib Rahman Mazumder. I’m someone who seeks solace in words and tranquility in chaos. 
        When every other means seemed futile, incongruous, and abject, poetry soothed me with its warmth. 
        Even though writing started as a gateway to ecstasy, an escape from reality, it gave birth to a new way of connecting with others. 
        I explore emotions often left unspoken: dissonance, self-contemplation, reflection, and resilience. 
        When the words and images resonate with others, they see true beauty in perfect imperfections.

        <h2>Why I write?</h2>
    <p>
        My inspiration behind every poem and every word comes from inner turmoil, fleeting rays of hope, and the intertwining Yin and Yang of life. 
        Music and abstract art also influence my work, often serving as the backbone of my words.

    <h2>What to expect?</h2>
    <p>Here, you can expect to read poems that reflect life’s complexities, introspection, intense emotions, existential dilemmas, and human psychology, wrapped in vivid imagery and profound authenticity.
      I hope my words bring you comfort, captivate your mind, or simply remind you that you are not alone in the chaos.
