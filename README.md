# Poetry Portfolio – Development Log

This repository tracks my progress building a personal poetry portfolio website
while revising core web development fundamentals (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and databases).

The goal is to document both learning and implementation in a structured, transparent way.

## 📌 Project Goals
- Build a clean, text-focused poetry portfolio website
- Strengthen HTML semantics and accessibility
- Learn CSS layout and responsive design
- Gradually introduce JavaScript and backend concepts
